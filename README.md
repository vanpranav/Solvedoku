# Solvedoku

Solvedoku is a script written in python which scrapes a Sudoku website to get the Sudoku puzzle generated by the site and tries to solve using Backtracking technique.

Since the puzzles are generated on the fly by the site, there is a guaranteed chance of getting a new puzzle each time the script is run.

Note: A puzzle may contain more than 1 solution to a puzzle, the script is currently capable of producing all the solutions.
